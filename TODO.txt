- Instructions for how to filter your email if found.
  This might not be worth it, considering the email will already be archived
  by places like GHArchive...

- If you contribute to a repo and delete your fork, this would fail to scan it because it's not under your repos.
  Find a way to discover commits from users across all of github, and scan that? 
  That's basically what event scanning is, it's just event history can be cleared.

- Research GHArchive searching with google BigQuery integration.
  I'd like to look into this, but it requires paying for BigQuery.
  It would allow finding emails like Events, but works even after the events are gone
   (whether cleared by github at request, or just >1 month I think is the limit)

- Occasionally, scanning a commit will send an error when something isn't defined.
  This isn't a big deal but I should probably silence it.
